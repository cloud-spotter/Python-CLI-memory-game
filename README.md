# Python CLI Memory Game

## Description

This program allows a single player to enjoy a simple memory game on the command line. The game, also known as "Concentration" or "Pairs", challenges the player to match pairs of cards from a grid of face-down cards.

The initial version of this program was generated with AI assistance and served as an exercise in reviewing and enhancing existing code. Through user feedback and iterative improvements, additional features were built upon the basic starter edition.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game from the command line.
2. The game will display a grid representation of 'face-down' cards.
3. On each turn, select two cards by entering their coordinates.
4. If the selected cards match, they will remain 'face-up'.
5. If the cards do not match, they will be hidden again.
6. Continue selecting pairs of cards until all pairs have been matched.
7. The game ends when all cards are face-up, and the number of moves made to win is displayed.
